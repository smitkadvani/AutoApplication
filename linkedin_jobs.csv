We are now looking for a Senior Infrastructure Software Engineer for Deep Learning Libraries!

NVIDIA's Deep Learning Libraries Group is seeking excellent software engineers to enable the next wave of NVIDIA’s highest performing deep learning libraries. The role spans multiple products, including cuDNN , TensorRT , and CUDA kernel libraries. The mission is to design and develop scalable, modular infrastructure that streamlines development, builds, and tests across NVIDIA’s diverse set of platforms, from Drive AGX for autonomous vehicles to DGX servers for datacenters and large language models. Join our technically diverse team of software engineers and infrastructure experts to design the systems that enable NVIDIA to stay ahead of the competition as we deliver the world's fastest deep learning platforms.

What You'll Be Doing

 Designing and developing software for testing and analysis of our codebases 
 Building scalable automation for build, test, integration, and release processes for publicly distributed deep learning libraries 
 Developing throughout the software stack, from the user experience and user interfaces down to the cluster and database layers 
 Configuring, maintaining, and building upon deployments of industry-standard tools (e.g. Kubernetes, Jenkins, Docker, CMake, Gitlab, Jira, etc.) 
 Develop front-end solutions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related web technologies 
 Advancing the state of the art in those industry-standard tools 

What We Need To See

 A Masters Degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering or equivalent experience. 
 3+ years of relevant experience 
 Strong programming skills in Python (or similar) and familiarity with C/C++ development 
 Experience setting up, maintaining, and automating continuous integration systems (e.g. Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines, Azure DevOps) 
 Experience in HTML5, CSS, NodeJS, or React 
 Fluency in SCM (e.g. Git, Perforce) and build systems (e.g. Make, CMake, Bazel) 

Ways To Stand Out From The Crowd

 Experience designing and developing automation in Jenkins with Groovy (or similar) 
 Background with distributed systems and cluster/cloud computing, especially with Kubernetes 
 Experience designing and developing unit and integration test frameworks 
 Experience with mobile/embedded platforms and multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, RedHat, Windows, QNX, or similar) 
 Track record of identifying useful new technologies and incorporating them into SW development flows
