Description: People hire people. Looking for a new job or trying to hire that critical person isn't fun. Finding the best opportunity and hiring the right person is more than an application and a resume. The hiring and interviewing process can be time consuming and tolling, which requires a trusted source to aid in communication, screening, preparation, scheduling, and feedback.

Averity began out of the desire to create a different recruitment firm in New York City that not only provides the highest level of service to its clients and candidates, but also creates a positive team-oriented work environment where together everyone achieves more. The success is based heavily on the production of the team, not just the individual, creating a culture based on core values of Communication, Ethics, Innovation, Positive-Energy and Delivery.

There is a gap in connecting top tier talent within the Information Technology and Engineering sectors. As these industries continue to grow, the demand for a sophisticated web presence, monetization of data through business intelligence and a realizable return on online advertising will continue to increase. Averity will aim to fill a void left by other permanent placement and contract-staffing agencies.
